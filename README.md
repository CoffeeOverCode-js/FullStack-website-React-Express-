# Cool Tech Project

## Created By: Ryan Fredericks

This project is a website that uses different tools to make it work. 
It uses React for the Frontend, Express for the Backend, and MongoDB 
With Mongoose to store and organize information on a Database.

## Installation

The first thing you have to do is to go into the Backend and Frontend 
Folder where the code files are situated.
And run the following command first:

npm install 

Once you have ran the command npm install
You must then run the command npm start in both
The frontend and Backend directories as you did
With the npm install.

## Usage


Once the Frontend has loaded successfully, you'll need to either 
log in or register. This can be done by clicking on the login or 
Register button. After registering, you'll gain access to features 
Such as adding and updating your own credentials as a Normal User.

However other features are available at higher Roles: 
Management Role - Update other User Credentials
Admin Role - All the features of a Management Role
           - Including the feature to update Management
             Role and Normal Users Role
